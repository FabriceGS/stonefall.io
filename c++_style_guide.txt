C++ Style Guide:
Include Guards on Headers! (Preprocessor Macros in all caps) Include guards or more declarative, 
and are less error prone to edge cases, which will be important if we plan to keep importing 
different parts of external libraries.

Hard line wraps at 100 lines.

Always place the const after the & or * if you want to specify a pointer/reference that cannot
be targeted somewhere else.
